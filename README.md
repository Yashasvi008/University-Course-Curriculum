Knowledge has little value without the necessary skills and practice needed in order to apply that knowledge to real-life situations. Courses must be regarded as building blocks for the skills they are meant to develop and thus structured in a mannerly order.  

While considering this perspective, one must realise the importance of having a well-developed structure among different courses. This is where the problem of scheduling different courses, on various topics, while still maintaining the necessary coherence from a student perspective, starts rising question marks.

This project describes a near-optimal method for scheduling course placement in a university programme, (utilising the topological sort algorithm) with regards to the number of credits per semester, inter-disciplinary prerequisites and other optional external factors. The project also includes the functionality of acyclicity check on the input file, as well as an option to add a new course.

The proposed method is to be implemented in a software application developed in Python using Tkinter framework, using predefined CSV files as inputs. The application will output a description of the calculated scheduling method, in the form of a list of semesters.
